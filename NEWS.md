# fable 0.4.0

## New features

* Added `generate()` and `IRF()` methods for VAR models.
* Added `IRF()` method for ARIMA models.
* Added `VECM()` and `VARIMA()` models.

## Improvements

* Documentation improvements.

# fable 0.3.4

Small patch to resolve issues in C++ R headers.

## Improvements

* Documentation improvements.

# fable 0.3.3

Small patch to resolve CRAN check issues.

## Improvements

* Documentation improvements.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed `generate(<ARIMA>)` method for some variable names.
* Fixed df in `generate(<TSLM>)`.

# fable 0.3.2

## Improvements

* Documentation improvements.
* Added `approx_normal` argument to `forecast(<TSLM>)`. This allows you to
  optionally return forecasts from the more appropriate Student's T distribution
  instead of approximating to a Normal distribution. The default behaviour 
  remains the same, which is to provide approximate Normal distribution 
  forecasts which are nicer to work with in model combination and reconciliation
  (#343).
* `ETS()` will now ignore the smoothing parameter's range when specific 
  parameter value is given (#317).
* Modified initial parameter values for `ETS()` when bounds = "admissible".
* Updated RW forecasts to use an unbiased estimate of sigma2 (#368).

## Bug fixes

* Fixed issue with characteristic equation test for admissibility of ETS 
  parameters (#341).
* Fixed ARIMA selecting differences that don't satisfy the `order_constraint` 
  (#360).
* Fixed issue with forecasting ARIMA models with intercept and exogenous 
  regressors.
* Fixed issue with VAR models not storing lagged regressor data for forecasting.


# fable 0.3.1

Small release to resolve check issues with the development and patched versions 
of R. The release includes some minor improvements to the output consistency of
initial states in `ETS()` models, the passing of arguments in `ARIMA()` models,
and handling of missing values in `NNETAR()`.

## Improvements

* Display of ETS initial states now use a `state[t]` notation to describe the
  state's position in time (#329, #261).
* Allowed specifying `method` argument in `ARIMA()` (#330).
* Improved handling of missing values in `NNETAR()` (#327).

## Bug fixes

* Fixed error with forecasting and simulating from `NNETAR()` estimated using
  a short series (#326).
* Fixed `AR()` fitted values not being re-scaled to match original data (#318).

# fable 0.3.0

The release of fabletools v0.3.0 introduced general support for computing h-step 
ahead fitted values, using the `hfitted(<mdl>, h = ???)` function. This release
adds model-specific `hfitted()` support to ARIMA and ETS models for improved
performance and accuracy.

This release adds improved support for refitting models, largely in thanks to
contributions by @Tim-TU.

It is also now possible to specify an arbitrary model selection criterion 
function for automatic `ARIMA()` model selection.

## New features

* Added `refit()` method for NNETAR, MEAN, RW, SNAIVE, and NAIVE models 
  (#287, #289, #321. @Tim-TU).
* Added `hfitted()` method for ETS and ARIMA, this allows fast estimation of 
  h-step ahead fitted values.
* Added `generate()` method for AR, the `forecast()` method now supports
  bootstrap forecasting via this new method.

## Improvements

* Added the `selection_metric` argument to `ARIMA()`, which allows more control
  over the measure used to select the best model. By default this function will
  extract the information criteria specified by the `ic` argument.
* Added `trace` argument for tracing the selection procedure used in `ARIMA()`

## Bug fixes

* Fixed unnecessary warning when forecasting short horizons using `NNETAR()`.
* Fixed `generate()` method for NNETAR models when data isn't scaled (#302).
* Fixed `refit.ARIMA()` re-selecting constant instead of using the provided
  model's constant usage.
* Fixed use of exogenous regressors in `AR()` models.

# fable 0.2.1

This release coincides with v0.2.0 of the fabletools package, which contains
some substantial changes to the output of `forecast()` methods.
These changes to fabletools emphasise the distribution in the fable 
object. The most noticeable is a change in column names of the fable, with the
distribution now stored in the column matching the response variable, and the
forecast mean now stored in the `.mean` column. 
For a complete summary of these changes, refer to the fabletools v0.2.0 release
news: https://fabletools.tidyverts.org/news/index.html

## New features

* Added the `THETA()` method.

## Improvements

* Forecasts distributions are now provided by the distributional package. They
  are now more space efficient and allows calculation of distributional 
  statistics including the `mean()`, `median()`, `variance()`, `quantile()`,
  `cdf()`, and  `density()`.
* The uncertainty of the drift parameter in random walk models (`RW()`, 
  `NAIVE()` and `SNAIVE()`) is now included in data generated with `generate()`.
* Added Syntetos-Boylan and Shale-Boylan-Johnston variants of `CROSTON()` method.
* Performance improvements.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed issue with approximation being used when refitting ARIMA models and when
  a specific model is requested.
* Fixed `glance()` for `TSLM()` models when the data contains missing values.
* Fixed typo in `glance()` output of `ETS()` models.

## Breaking changes

* The sample path means are now used instead of analytical means when forecasts 
  are produced from sample paths.

# fable 0.2.0

## Improvements

* Added autoregressive modelling with `AR()`.
* Better handling of rank deficiency in `ARIMA()`.
* Added `generate.ARIMA()` method.
* Added bootstrap forecast paths for `ARIMA()` models.
* `ARIMA()` specials now allow specifying fixed coefficients via the `fixed` argument.
* Documentation improvements.

# fable 0.1.2

## Improvements

* Added `CROSTON()` for Croston's method of intermittent demand forecasting.
* Documentation improvements

## Bug fixes

* Fixed NNETAR & VAR handling of missing values (#215).
* Fix ETS forecasting with forecast horizons less than the seasonal period (#219).
* Fixed season() special for non-seasonally based time indices (#220)
* Fix issue with simulation forecasting from damped ETS models.

# fable 0.1.1

## Improvements

* Added interpolation method for `MEAN()` model (#203).
* Added rolling mean option for `MEAN()` model (#204).

## Bug fixes

* Corrected forecast standard error for drift models.

# fable 0.1.0

* First release.

## New features

* Support for 9 models and relevant methods: `ARIMA`, `ETS`, `TSLM`, `MEAN`, `RW`, `NAIVE`, `SNAIVE`, `NNETAR`, `VAR`.
