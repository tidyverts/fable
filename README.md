The R package *fable* provides a collection of commonly used univariate
and multivariate time series forecasting models including exponential
smoothing via state space models and automatic ARIMA modelling. These
models work within the fable framework, which provides the tools to
evaluate, visualise, and combine models in a workflow consistent with
the tidyverse.

## Installation

You can install the **stable** version from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fable):

``` r
install.packages("fable")
```

You can install the **development** version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverts/fable)

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tidyverts/fable")
```

Installing this software requires a compiler

## Example

``` r
library(fable)
library(tsibble)
library(tsibbledata)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
aus_retail %>%
  filter(
    State %in% c("New South Wales", "Victoria"),
    Industry == "Department stores"
  ) %>% 
  model(
    ets = ETS(box_cox(Turnover, 0.3)),
    arima = ARIMA(log(Turnover)),
    snaive = SNAIVE(Turnover)
  ) %>%
  forecast(h = "2 years") %>% 
  autoplot(filter(aus_retail, year(Month) > 2010), level = NULL)
```

## Learning to forecast with fable

- The pkgdown site describes all models provided by fable, and how they
  are used: <https://fable.tidyverts.org/>
- The forecasting principles and practices online textbook provides an
  introduction to time series forecasting using fable:
  <https://otexts.com/fpp3/> (WIP)
  <!-- - A quick start functionality guide can be found here: https://tidyverts.github.io/tidy-forecasting-principles/ (WIP) -->

## Getting help

- Questions about forecasting can be asked on [Cross
  Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/tags/forecasting).

- Common questions about the fable package are often found on [Stack
  Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/fable+r). You can use this to
  ask for help if the question isnâ€™t already answered. A [minimally
  reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) that describes
  your issue is the best way to ask for help!
